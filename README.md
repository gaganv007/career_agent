# METCS-633-BU-Agent
An agent fine-tuned for BU Students to ask about career advice and recommended course.

## Problem Statement
Choosing the right courses and planning a career path can be overwhelming for both prospective and current students at Boston University. With a vast array of programs, concentrations, and extracurricular opportunities, students often struggle to find accurate, relevant, and personalized information to make informed decisions about their academic and professional futures.

While resources exist across university websites, advising offices, and student forums, they are often fragmented, inconsistent, or hard to navigate. This results in missed opportunities, inefficient course planning, and confusion about how academic choices align with career goals.

To address this, our project aims to build an intelligent agent that leverages Gemini to provide real-time, context-aware responses to student inquiries. Whether it's helping a prospective student understand which major suits their interests or guiding a current student on which electives align with a data science career, the agent delivers accurate and accessible adviceâ€”bridging the gap between university resources and student needs.

## Library 
We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to manage libraries for our project. To ensure each developer is using the same libraries, follow these instructions.

1. [Create a Virual Environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) in your local copy of the [repo](https://github.com/gaganv007/career_agent)
2. Activate your virtual environment
3. Open a [terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/getting-started)
4. Type "pip install uv"
5. Type "uv sync"

Your libraries should now match the dependencies listed in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
