Event_Content: Okay, let's talk about education. While a computer science degree is a common path, it's not the *only* path. Here are a few options to consider:

*   **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science:** A traditional four-year degree provides a strong foundation in computer science principles, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering.
*   **Related Degree with a Focus on Programming:** Fields like mathematics, physics, or electrical engineering can also provide a solid base, especially if you supplement them with programming courses or self-study.
*   **Bootcamps:** These intensive programs can quickly equip you with in-demand skills, but they require significant time and financial investment.
*   **Online Courses and Self-Study:** Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and edX offer a wide range of computer science and programming courses. This can be a flexible and affordable way to learn, but it requires discipline and self-motivation.

What are your thoughts on these different educational paths, Jeff? Do any of them seem more appealing or feasible for you?
